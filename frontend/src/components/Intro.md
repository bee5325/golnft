Conways game of life is a cellular automation, with only 4 simple rules:

-  Any live cell with **fewer than two** live neighbours <span class="text-red-800 font-bold">dies</span>, as if by
  underpopulation.
-  Any live cell with **two or three** live neighbours <span class="text-green-600 font-bold">lives</span> on to the next
  generation.
-  Any live cell with **more than three** live neighbours <span class="text-red-800 font-bold">dies</span>, as if by
  overpopulation.
-  Any dead cell with **exactly three** live neighbours becomes a <span class="text-green-600 font-bold">live</span> cell,
  as if by reproduction.

With such simple rules, there are infinite possibilities that a how an
evolution will go. Try it out yourself!
