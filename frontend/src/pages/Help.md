## Connect to Arbitrum One

Arbitrum One is Layer 2 chain for Ethereum that built to speed up transactions
and reduce gas fee (a lot).

### Automatic Network Switching

When you visit [mint](/mint) page, We will detect if you are connected
to Arbitrum One network. You will be notified if you are not on the correct
network. Simply click on the link on the popup to add Arbitrum One network
to your wallet, and switch to the correct network.

### Manual Network Switching

If you prefer to add the network yourself, you can go to Metamask settings >
Networks > New network. Enter the following details:

- Network Name: Arbitrum One
- New RPC URL: https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
- Chain ID: 42161
- Symbol: ETH
- Block Explorer URL: https://arbiscan.io

And click save. You can then switch to the newly added Arbitrum One manually.

## Transfer ETH to Arbitrum One

To use Arbitrum network, you will first need to transfer your ETH from
Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum network. You can use the [official Arbitrum bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/)
to do so.

Take note that bridging from L1 to L2 will take around 10 minutes, while
bridging from L2 back to L2 will take 7 days! You can however use some DEX
to transfer from L2 back to L1 instantly with some fee.
