## What is Arbitrum and how do I use it?

Arbitrum is Layer 2 chain for Ethereum that built to speed up transactions
and reduce gas fee (a lot).

To use Arbitrum network, you will first need to transfer your ETH from
Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum network. You can use the [official Arbitrum bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/)
to do so.

Take note that bridging from L1 to L2 will take around 10 minutes, while
bridging from L2 back to L2 will take 7 days! You can however use some DEX
to transfer from L2 back to L1 instantly with some fee.

Besides getting ETH in Arbitrum, you will need to add the network in your
Metamask in order to use it. To do this, go to Metamask settings > Networks >
New network. Enter the following details:

- Network Name: Arbitrum One
- New RPC URL: https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
- Chain ID: 42161
- Symbol: ETH
- Block Explorer URL: https://arbiscan.io

## How to connect to Metamask

1. First, you will need to have Metamask installed to your browser.
   You can get the download [here](https://metamask.io/download/).
2. On the [mint](/mint) page, click on the button "Connect to your wallet".
3. Make sure your Metamask wallet is connected to Arbitrum network. Follow the
   instructions above if you need help on that.
4. If everything is done correctly, the mint button will turn green, suggesting that
   you are ready to mint your NFT!

## How to mint

1. Choose the number of rows of the board that you would like to mint. The value should
   be between 3 and 16.
3. Click on the mint button.
4. Confirm the transaction in Metamask popup.
